- add flashcards for testing
- add the direct translator to flashcard app
## main.py and flaschcards.py
- met to create an overall structure so we could program individually on our games first
- choose a color scheme so both games would match 
- the first problem occurred when Paula could not see the changes Frieda commited -> asked ChatGPT on what we could try to fix the problem
- To see if the Program was working in itself we asked ChatGPT to write a Memory Game just to test if all the different files were connected

## Memory Game 
the structure of the memory game is very simple. Therefore there were quite a lot of example Code available on Github
This helped me to program the first structure of the game quite fast and only a few opstecals occurred. However with going deeper
in the design with tkinker it was firstly quite complicated because ive never worked with the library. So i firstly researched how the 
library worked and what I could achieve with it. Here ive looked on YouTube and watched several beginner Tutorials on How tkinter works e.g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibf5cx221hk. After some research it was very noticable stat the structure of tkinster is similar to PyCharm. 
Through e.g. tk.Button() you were able to create a Button and modify it within the Breckits. 


- Initial research
- crating an overview on the structure on of the code 
  - Class Memory Game
  - mostly needed to google ones how to do it, then code blocks were also repetative in matter of design
