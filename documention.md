- add flashcards for testing
- add the direct translator to flashcard app
- We crated the main idea in class on how we would like to create a gamified learning application. The first step stareted with one of the 
weekly assignment where we should search on Github to find similar code.
-  first file structure in class and for the presentation, we started to write def to create the first outline
- 
## main.py and flaschcards.py
- met to create an overall structure so we could program individually on our games first
- choose a color scheme so both games would match 
- the first problem occurred when Paula could not see the changes Frieda commited -> asked ChatGPT on what we could try to fix the problem
- To see if the Program was working in itself we asked ChatGPT to write a Memory Game just to test if all the different files were connected

## Memory Game 
the structure of the memory game is very simple. Therefore there were quite a lot of example Code available on Github
This helped me to program the first structure of the game quite fast and only a few opstacles occurred. However with going deeper
in the design with tkinker it was firstly quite complicated because ive never worked with the library. So i firstly researched how the 
library worked and what I could achieve with it. Here ive looked on YouTube and watched several beginner Tutorials on How tkinter works e.g
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibf5cx221hk. After some research it was very noticable that the structure of tkinster is similar to PyGame. 
Through e.g. tk.Button() you were able to create a Button and modify it within the Breckits. 
- crated design within the colorsceme
- wanted rounded cards
- wanting cards to flip

- Initial research
- crating an overview on the structure on of the code 
  - Class Memory Game
  - mostly needed to google ones how to do it, then code blocks were also repetative in matter of design

        online meeting together, planing next steps. Paula is responsible for designing the main.py interface and Frieda is reosposible for the flashcards.py interface
        major problem: Frieda cannot push the old repository and therefore no updates accur. Trying several approchaces to fix the bug however nothing works. No Reddit Account and no AI ChatBot was able to help us -> created a new repositories only way we were able to fix the problem
  - Problem: Flashcard editing not possible
  - established design sceme so both apps will looks similar at the end
